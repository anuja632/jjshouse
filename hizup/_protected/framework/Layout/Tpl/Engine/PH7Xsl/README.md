# pH7Xsl (XSLT PHP Template Engine) 🎨

This is a **simple** but **effective** and **powerful** **template engine** running **PHP** with **XSLT** (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations).

With **XSLT syntax**, your **template code** may be **portable** to virtually any **programming language**.

It also allows for the **separation** of **PHP code** and **template code** to have much more **professional software** and a **template** that is much **cleaner** and **clearer**.
